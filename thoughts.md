I have to rethink the code a bit. I already worked on initalizing 
the porfolio and tickers. Now, I have to make it in a way such that
I can:

-> load my portfolio
-> add new operations
-> generate useful insights

Again, I could always initialize the code each time I execute it, but that's not really ok.
